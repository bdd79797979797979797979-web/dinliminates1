# CURRENT RELEASE — BUILD 698 / CP698

Date: 2026-10-02

Current candidate branch: `cp698-iphone-usage-pass`
Recovery baseline: `cp697-address-credit-polish`
Hosted test target: `dinliminate22`
Status: candidate — not production

## CP698 iPhone usage pass
- Restored Safari-safe **16px text sizing** for editable Restaurant address and restaurant-search fields so iPhone Safari does not zoom the page when those fields receive focus.
- Added **Search** keyboard return hints to the Restaurant address and restaurant search fields.
- When manual address editing begins while the automatic GPS request is still pending, the pending GPS result is invalidated so it cannot overwrite the address the user is entering.
- Increased the compact Restaurant location action hit areas on phones to **44px** on standard iPhone widths, with a tighter 40px layout for very narrow screens.
- Preserved the existing compact visual hierarchy, restaurant search behavior, radius tiers, Quick Cuts, photos, swipe mechanics, and navigation.

## CP698 verification
- Source confirms pending-location cancellation on both address focus and address input.
- Source confirms Restaurant address/search fields use iPhone Search return hints.
- Final mobile CSS restores 16px editable-field sizing after later compact Restaurant rules.
- Restaurant location action hit areas are 44px at max-width 430px and 40px below 360px.
- App asset query advanced from v666 to v667.
- Release metadata is synchronized to Build 698 / CP698.

CP488 verified repair:
- Restored Smoothie; built-in meal catalog is 116 unique meals.
- Synchronized stale QA contracts to Build 197 / r22 / 100-mile behavior.
- Refreshed hosted Netlify smoke for the current preview.
- Aligned current food-image hosts across client proxy, server proxy, service worker, and QA.

- Quick Pass/Full Pass selection, player count, names, full-card swipe, button controls, Back/Undo, and return to the narrowed Tinder deck are covered by regression tests.
