Hosted test target: `dinliminate22`

- Preserved the existing compact visual hierarchy, restaurant search behavior, radius tiers, Quick Cuts, photos, swipe mechanics, and navigation.

## CP698 verification
- Source confirms pending-location cancellation on both address focus and address input.
- Source confirms Restaurant address/search fields use iPhone Search return hints.

- Restaurant location action hit areas are 44px at max-width 430px and 40px below 360px.
